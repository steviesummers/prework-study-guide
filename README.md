## A study guide for Bootcamp Prework

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

My motivation was setting myself up for success and make learning as easy as possible for myself.
 This project was built in an effort to centralize all applicable information on the introduction to coding.
This project has solved the problem of "where do I start" when it comes time to study.
I learned how to create files and move through the computer via the terminal. I learned the importance of pushing and pulling information from the dipository, and I learned that all of the skills we went over build on eachother and are needed for efficent website creation.



## Installation

## Usage

This study guide can be used as a resource on the introduction lessons of class. HTML covers the foundation of website creation, like how the head element contain information about the webpage and the body is what the user sees when using the webpage. CSS is how a webpage looks. Examples include: the "padding" refers to how much space is wanted within an element and the margin the space surrounding an element. Git is where we store our dipositories and can be accessed and utilized throught he terminal. And finally, JaveScript is the logic in which a page is used to connect the graphical elements to the function. These can be set using 'if' statements and using console.log() to test the changes.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
